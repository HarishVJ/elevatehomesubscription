# Match Score Calculation Algorithm

## Overview

The Replacement Search Agent uses a **point-based scoring system** to rank replacement products. Each product starts with a base score and gains/loses points based on how well it matches the original product.

---

## üéØ Scoring Formula

### **Base Score**
```
Starting Score: 100 points
Minimum Viable Score: 60 points
```

Products below 60 points are **disqualified** and not shown.

---

## üìä Score Components

### **1. Type Match** (CRITICAL - Must Match)
```
‚úì Same type (e.g., both "range"):  +10 points
‚úó Different type:                   DISQUALIFIED (score = 0)
```

**Example**:
- Original: Range
- Replacement: Range ‚Üí ‚úì +10 points
- Replacement: Dishwasher ‚Üí ‚úó DISQUALIFIED

---

### **2. Size Match** (CRITICAL)

```
Exact match (e.g., both 30"):       +20 points
Within 1 inch (29-31"):             +15 points
Within 2 inches (28-32"):           +10 points
More than 2 inches difference:      -50 points
```

**Example**:
- Original: 30 inch range
- Replacement: 30 inch ‚Üí ‚úì +20 points
- Replacement: 29 inch ‚Üí ‚úì +15 points
- Replacement: 28 inch ‚Üí ‚úì +10 points
- Replacement: 36 inch ‚Üí ‚úó -50 points

**Tolerance**: 2 inches (configurable)

---

### **3. Fuel Match** (CRITICAL for applicable appliances)

```
Same fuel type:                     +20 points
Different fuel type:                -50 points
Not applicable (e.g., dishwasher):  No penalty
```

**Example**:
- Original: Gas range
- Replacement: Gas ‚Üí ‚úì +20 points
- Replacement: Electric ‚Üí ‚úó -50 points
- Replacement: Dual fuel ‚Üí ‚úó -50 points

---

### **4. Feature Matching** (IMPORTANT)

```
Each matched feature:               +10 points per feature
Each missing feature:               -15 points per feature
```

**Example**:
- Original features: `["convection", "air fry", "self cleaning", "wifi", "5 burners"]`
- Replacement has: `["convection", "air fry", "wifi"]`

**Calculation**:
- Matched: 3 features √ó 10 = +30 points
- Missing: 2 features √ó 15 = -30 points
- **Net**: 0 points from features

**Better Match**:
- Replacement has: `["convection", "air fry", "self cleaning", "wifi", "5 burners", "griddle"]`
- Matched: 5 features √ó 10 = +50 points
- Missing: 0 features √ó 15 = 0 points
- **Net**: +50 points from features

---

### **5. Availability Bonus** (OPTIONAL)

```
In stock:                           +10 points
Limited stock:                      +5 points
Unknown:                            +3 points
Out of stock:                       0 points
```

---

### **6. Price Information Bonus** (OPTIONAL)

```

No price:                           0 points
```
