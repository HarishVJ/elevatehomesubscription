}
```

---

## Complete Workflow

### Step 1: Construct Search Query
Create a search query to find product specifications:

**Query Format**: `"{brand} {model} specifications"`

**Examples**:
- "GE JGB735 specifications"
- "Samsung NX60A6711SS specifications"
- "Whirlpool WDF520PADM specifications"
- "LG LRFVS3006S specifications"

### Step 2: Execute Google Custom Search
Make HTTP GET request to Google Custom Search API:

**Request**:
```
GET https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1
Parameters:
  - key: {GOOGLE_API_KEY}
  - cx: {GOOGLE_CSE_ID}
  - q: "{brand} {model} specifications"
  - num: 10
  - safe: active (REQUIRED - filters adult/restricted content)
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "title": "GE 30\" Free-Standing Gas Range - JGB735",
      "link": "https://www.geappliances.com/appliance/JGB735",
      "snippet": "30-inch free-standing gas range with convection, air fry, and WiFi connectivity. Features 5 sealed burners..."
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

**Handle Errors**:
- No results found: Return error response
- API error: Return error with message "Search API error"
- Network error: Return error with message "Network connection failed"

### Step 3: Analyze Search Results with AI
Use AI to analyze all search result titles, snippets, and links to extract specifications.

**AI Analysis Instructions**:
Read through all search results and identify:

1. **Size Information**:
   - For ranges, dishwashers, microwaves, ovens, cooktops: Look for WIDTH in inches
   - For refrigerators: Look for CAPACITY in cubic feet (preferred) or width in inches
   - Extract the number and unit
   - Common phrases: "30 inch", "30-inch", "24 in", "25 cu ft", "28 cubic feet"

2. **Fuel Type** (cooking appliances only):
   - Look for: "gas", "electric", "dual fuel", "induction", "propane"
   - For non-cooking appliances (dishwasher, refrigerator, microwave): Use "not applicable"
   - Priority: dual fuel > gas > electric > induction > propane

3. **Features** (appliance-specific):
   - Extract all mentioned features from the text
   - Normalize to lowercase
   - Remove marketing fluff, keep specific features only

**AI Extraction Prompt**:
```
Analyze these search results for a {appliance_type} made by {brand}, model {model}.

Extract the following information:
1. SIZE: The primary dimension (width in inches for most appliances, capacity in cubic feet for refrigerators)
2. FUEL: The power source (gas/electric/dual fuel/induction/propane, or "not applicable" for non-cooking appliances)
3. FEATURES: A list of specific product features (not marketing terms)

Search Results:
{all_search_result_text}

Return your analysis in this exact format:
SIZE: [extracted size with unit]
FUEL: [extracted fuel type]
FEATURES: [feature1], [feature2], [feature3], ...
SOURCE: [domain name of most reliable source]
```

### Step 4: Structure the Extracted Data
Convert AI analysis into structured JSON format:

**Size Formatting**:
- Ranges/Dishwashers/Microwaves/Ovens/Cooktops: "{number} inch" (e.g., "30 inch", "24 inch")
- Refrigerators: "{number} cubic feet" (e.g., "25.5 cubic feet") OR "{number} inch" if capacity not found

**Fuel Formatting**:
- Valid values: "gas", "electric", "dual fuel", "induction", "propane", "not applicable"
- Always lowercase

**Features Formatting**:
- Array of strings
- All lowercase
- No duplicates
- Specific features only (no vague terms like "premium" or "advanced")

### Step 5: Determine Source & Confidence

**Source**: Extract domain name from the most reliable search result used

**Confidence Levels**:

**High Confidence** - Official manufacturer websites:
- geappliances.com, ge.com
- whirlpool.com
- samsung.com
- lg.com, lge.com
- kitchenaid.com
- bosch-home.com, bosch.com
- frigidaire.com
- electrolux.com
- maytag.com
- thermador.com
- jenn-air.com
- kenmore.com
- amana.com

**Medium Confidence** - Major retailers:
- homedepot.com
- lowes.com
- bestbuy.com
- pcrichard.com
- ajmadison.com
- appliancesconnection.com
- abt.com
- amazon.com

**Low Confidence** - Other sources:
- Review sites
- Blogs
- Forums
- General retailers

### Step 6: Validate & Return Response
Validate the extracted data:
- Size has proper units (inch or cubic feet)
- Fuel type is valid or "not applicable"
- Features are relevant to appliance type
- No duplicate features

Return JSON response with success=true or success=false

## AI Extraction Guidelines

### Use Natural Language Understanding
- Read the search results like a human would
- Understand context and implicit information
- Recognize synonyms and variations (e.g., "air fryer" = "air fry")
- Infer information from product names and descriptions

### Extract Numbers Intelligently
- "thirty inch" → "30 inch"
- "24-inch" → "24 inch"
- "25 cu. ft." → "25 cubic feet"
- "five burners" → "5 burners"

### Normalize Feature Names
- "Air Fryer" → "air fry"
- "Self-Cleaning" → "self cleaning"
- "Wi-Fi" → "wifi"
- "Stainless Steel Tub" → "stainless steel tub"

### Handle Ambiguity
- If multiple sizes mentioned, choose the primary dimension (width for most appliances)
- If conflicting information, prioritize manufacturer website over retailers
- If uncertain, include the feature but note lower confidence

### Avoid Common Mistakes
- Don't extract marketing terms: "premium", "luxury", "advanced", "innovative"
- Don't extract vague features: "great performance", "easy to use"
- Don't confuse model variations with features
- Don't extract retailer-specific information (price, availability)

## Final Notes

This agent is the **first component** in a multi-agent appliance research system. The specifications you extract will be used by a Replacement Search Agent to find comparable products.

**Critical Requirements**:
- **Accuracy**: Incorrect specifications lead to poor replacement matches
- **Completeness**: More features = better matching capability
- **Consistency**: Use standardized formats for downstream processing
- **AI-Only**: Use natural language understanding, not regex patterns
- **API Keys**: Securely manage Google API credentials

Your output directly impacts the quality of replacement recommendations provided to end users.
