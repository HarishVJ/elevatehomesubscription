## Complete Workflow

### Step 1: Define Retailers to Search

**Target Retailers** (search in this order):
1. **Home Depot** - homedepot.com
2. **Lowe's** - lowes.com
3. **Best Buy** - bestbuy.com
4. **P.C. Richard & Son** - pcrichard.com

**Additional Retailers** (optional, if needed):
- AJ Madison - ajmadison.com
- Appliances Connection - appliancesconnection.com
- Abt Electronics - abt.com

### Step 2: Construct Search Queries

**Query Construction Rules**:

**If brand_for_brand = true**:
```
"{original_brand} {size} {fuel} {type} site:{retailer_domain}"
```
Example: "GE 30 inch gas range site:homedepot.com"

**If brand_for_brand = false**:
```
"{size} {fuel} {type} site:{retailer_domain}"
```
Example: "30 inch gas range site:homedepot.com"

**Query Components**:
- **Size**: Include if available (e.g., "30 inch", "24 inch", "28 cubic feet")
- **Fuel**: Include for cooking appliances (e.g., "gas", "electric", "dual fuel")
- **Type**: Always include (e.g., "range", "dishwasher", "refrigerator")
- **Site**: Restrict to specific retailer domain

**Example Queries**:
```
"30 inch gas range site:homedepot.com"
"30 inch gas range site:lowes.com"
"30 inch gas range site:bestbuy.com"
"30 inch gas range site:pcrichard.com"
```

### Step 3: Execute Searches for Each Retailer

For each retailer, make a Google Custom Search API request:

**Request**:
```
GET https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1
Parameters:
  - key: {GOOGLE_API_KEY}
  - cx: {GOOGLE_CSE_ID}
  - q: "{size} {fuel} {type} site:{retailer_domain}"
  - num: 10
  - safe: active (REQUIRED - filters adult/restricted content)
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "title": "Samsung 30 in. 6.0 cu. ft. Gas Range - NX60A6711SS",
      "link": "https://www.homedepot.com/p/Samsung-30-in-6-0-cu-ft-Smart-Slide-in-Gas-Range-NX60A6711SS/314224237",
      "snippet": "This Samsung 30-inch gas range features Air Fry mode, convection cooking, WiFi connectivity, and a large 6.0 cu. ft. oven capacity. $1,099.00"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Handle Errors**:
- No results for retailer: Continue to next retailer
- API error: Log error, continue to next retailer
- Rate limit exceeded: Return partial results

### Step 4: Extract Product Information with AI

For each search result, use AI to extract:

**AI Extraction Prompt**:
```
Analyze this product listing for a {type} appliance.

Product Title: {title}
Product URL: {link}
Product Description: {snippet}

Extract the following information:
1. PRODUCT_NAME: Full product name/title
2. BRAND: Manufacturer brand name
3. MODEL: Model number (if visible)
4. PRICE: Price in dollars (numeric value only, no $ symbol)
5. SIZE: Primary dimension with unit
6. FUEL: Fuel type (gas/electric/dual fuel/induction/propane/not applicable)
7. FEATURES: List of specific features mentioned
8. AVAILABILITY: Stock status (in stock/out of stock/limited stock/unknown)

Return in this format:
PRODUCT_NAME: [name]
BRAND: [brand]
MODEL: [model or "unknown"]
PRICE: [numeric value or null]
SIZE: [size with unit or null]
FUEL: [fuel type or null]
FEATURES: [feature1], [feature2], ...
AVAILABILITY: [status]
```

**AI Extraction Guidelines**:
- **Product Name**: Extract from title, clean up formatting
- **Brand**: Identify manufacturer (Samsung, LG, GE, Whirlpool, etc.)
- **Model**: Look for alphanumeric model numbers in title or snippet
- **Price**: Extract numeric value only (1099.00, not "$1,099")
- **Size**: Extract dimension with unit (30 inch, 24 inch, 28 cubic feet)
- **Fuel**: Identify from description (gas, electric, etc.)
- **Features**: Extract specific features mentioned in snippet
- **Availability**: Infer from text ("in stock", "available", "ships today" = in stock)

**Example AI Analysis**:
```
Input:
Title: "Samsung 30 in. 6.0 cu. ft. Gas Range - NX60A6711SS"
Snippet: "This Samsung 30-inch gas range features Air Fry mode, convection cooking, WiFi connectivity, and a large 6.0 cu. ft. oven capacity. $1,099.00"

Output:
PRODUCT_NAME: Samsung 30" Gas Range with Air Fry
BRAND: Samsung
MODEL: NX60A6711SS
PRICE: 1099.00
SIZE: 30 inch
FUEL: gas
FEATURES: air fry, convection, wifi
AVAILABILITY: in stock
```

### Step 5: Filter Products

Apply filters based on search criteria:

**Filter 1: Brand-for-Brand**
If `brand_for_brand = true`:
- Only keep products where brand matches original product brand (case-insensitive)
- Remove all other brands

**Filter 2: Dollar Limit**
If `dollar_limit` is specified (not null):
- Only keep products where price ≤ dollar_limit
- Remove products with no price information

**Filter 3: Size Match**
- Prioritize products with matching size
- Keep products with similar sizes (±2 inches for width, ±3 cubic feet for capacity)
- Remove products with significantly different sizes

**Filter 4: Fuel Match** (cooking appliances only)
- Prioritize products with matching fuel type
- Keep products with compatible fuel (e.g., dual fuel matches gas or electric)
- Remove products with incompatible fuel

**Filter 5: Remove Duplicates**
- If same model appears from multiple retailers, keep the one with lowest price
- If same product name from same retailer appears multiple times, keep first occurrence

### Step 6: Calculate Match Scores

For each product, calculate a match score based on how well it matches the original product:

**Scoring System**:

**Base Score**: 100 points

**Size Match**:
- Exact match: +50 points
- Close match (±2 inches or ±3 cu ft): +30 points
- Different size: +0 points

**Fuel Match** (cooking appliances only):
- Exact match: +30 points
- Compatible (e.g., dual fuel with gas/electric): +20 points
- Different fuel: +0 points

**Feature Matching**:
- For each matching feature: +5 points
- Bonus for 5+ matching features: +10 points
- Bonus for 8+ matching features: +20 points

**Price Consideration**:
- Under budget (if specified): +10 points
- Significantly under budget (>30% under): +5 points (lower price not always better)

**Availability**:
- In stock: +10 points
- Limited stock: +5 points
- Out of stock: -20 points

**Example Calculation**:
```
Original: GE 30" gas range with [convection, air fry, self cleaning, wifi, 5 burners]
Replacement: Samsung 30" gas range with [convection, air fry, wifi, griddle, 5 burners]

Base: 100
Size match (30" = 30"): +50
Fuel match (gas = gas): +30
Features matched (4): +20 (convection, air fry, wifi, 5 burners)
In stock: +10
Under budget: +10

Total Score: 220
```

### Step 7: Rank and Sort Products

**Sorting Priority**:
1. **Primary**: Match score (highest first)
2. **Secondary**: Price (lowest first, if scores are equal)
3. **Tertiary**: Availability (in stock first)

**Limit Results**:
- Return top 10 products maximum
- If fewer than 10 found, return all

### Step 8: Structure Match Details

For each product, provide detailed match information:

```json
{
  "match_details": {
    "size_match": true,
    "fuel_match": true,
    "features_matched": ["convection", "air fry", "wifi", "5 burners"],
    "features_missing": ["self cleaning"]
  }
}
```

**Match Details Fields**:
- `size_match`: Boolean - true if size matches exactly or closely
- `fuel_match`: Boolean - true if fuel type matches or compatible
- `features_matched`: Array - features present in both original and replacement
- `features_missing`: Array - features in original but not in replacement

### Step 9: Create Search Summary

Summarize the search results:

```json
{
  "search_summary": {
    "retailers_searched": 4,
    "total_products_found": 25,
    "products_returned": 10
  }
}
```

**Summary Fields**:
- `retailers_searched`: Number of retailers queried
- `total_products_found`: Total products found before filtering/ranking
- `products_returned`: Number of products in final results (max 10)

### Step 10: Return Response

Return complete JSON response with search summary and ranked replacements.

### Fuel Compatibility
Consider these fuel types compatible:
- **Dual Fuel** matches both **Gas** and **Electric**
- **Induction** is a type of **Electric**
- **Propane** is compatible with **Gas** (often convertible)

### Smart Feature Matching
Recognize feature synonyms:
- "air fry" = "air fryer" = "air frying"
- "self cleaning" = "self-cleaning" = "self clean"
- "wifi" = "wi-fi" = "smart" = "connected"
- "convection" = "true convection" = "fan convection"

### Price Extraction Intelligence
Handle various price formats:
- "$1,099.00" → 1099.00
- "$1099" → 1099.00
- "1099.99" → 1099.99
- "Starting at $999" → 999.00
- "Was $1299, Now $999" → 999.00 (use sale price)
